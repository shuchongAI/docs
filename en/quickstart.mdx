# Quick Start

Welcome to our API services! This guide helps you quickly get started with image and video generation.

## Step 1: Get an API Key

1. Visit the [API Key Management page](https://api.apimart.ai/console/token)
2. Sign in to your account
3. Create a new API key
4. Save your key securely (it is shown only once)

## Step 2: Choose a Model

We provide multiple AI models to choose from.

### Image Generation Models
- GPT-4o-image: High‑quality image generation

### Video Generation Models
- Sora2: Professional video generation

## Step 3: Send a Request

### Image generation example

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.apimart.ai/v1/images/generations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4o-image",
    "prompt": "A cute panda",
    "size": "1:1",
    "n": 1
  }'
```

### Video generation example

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.apimart.ai/v1/videos/generations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "sora-2",
    "prompt": "Waves crashing against the shore",
    "duration": 15,
    "aspect_ratio": "16:9"
  }'
```

## Step 4: Check Task Status

Because we use asynchronous processing, you need to query task status to obtain results.

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.apimart.ai/v1/tasks/YOUR_TASK_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```
