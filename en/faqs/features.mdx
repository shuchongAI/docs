## Why do API responses differ from official web versions (like ChatGPT, Claude)?

While using the same underlying models, there are differences between official web versions and API calls:

**Official Web Versions** include extensive engineering optimizations and enhanced features:
- Built-in internet search for real-time information
- Conversation memory that automatically links context
- Built-in calculator and code execution environment
- Pre-configured system prompts
- Optimized user interface

**API Calls** provide raw model capabilities:
- Only core reasoning and generation abilities
- Developers must manually manage conversation history
- Requires manual configuration of system prompts and context
- Requires self-integration of tool calling (Function Calling)

<Tip>
**Development Tip**: When using the API, actively configure system prompts (system messages), maintain conversation history, and integrate tool calling features as needed to achieve an experience closer to the web version.
