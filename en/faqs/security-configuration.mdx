## Q6: How to manage and protect API Keys?

Protect your API Key security:

- Do not commit API Keys in public code repositories
- Use environment variables to store API Keys
- Rotate API Keys regularly
- If an API Key is leaked, regenerate it immediately in the dashboard

<Warning>
API Key leaks can lead to unauthorized usage and financial losses. Please keep them secure.
</Warning>

<Tip>
We recommend using different API Keys for different environments (development, testing, production) for better management and security isolation.
