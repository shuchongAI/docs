## Q9: How to optimize API call costs?

Suggestions for cost optimization:

- Choose models suitable for your needs (different models have different prices)
- Use streaming responses to reduce waiting time
- Set reasonable token limits
- Cache common responses
- Monitor usage to avoid unexpected consumption

<Tip>
**Practical Tips**

1. **Choose the right model**: For simple tasks, lower-cost models can achieve good results
2. **Set max_tokens**: Limiting response length can effectively control costs
3. **Implement caching strategy**: Caching results for repeated or similar requests can significantly reduce call counts
4. **Use streaming responses**: Improves user experience while allowing early problem detection and unnecessary request interruption
